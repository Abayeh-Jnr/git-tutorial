Open VSCode:

After installation, open VSCode from your applications menu or by searching for it on your computer.
Install the Git Extension for VSCode:

Once VSCode is open, go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the sidebar or using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + X (or Cmd + Shift + X on macOS).
Search for "Git" in the search bar.
Install the "GitLens â€” Git supercharged" extension developed by Eric Amodio.
Configure Git Path (Optional):

If you already have Git installed on your computer, VSCode should automatically detect it. If not, you might need to specify the path to your Git executable:
Click on the gear icon in the lower left corner to open the settings.
Search for "git.path" and set the path to the location of your Git executable.
Save the settings.
Open a Repository:

Open VSCode and click on the "Open Folder" option.
Navigate to the local directory of your Git repository and select it.
VSCode will now display the files and folders of your repository.
Start Working with Git:

Use the Source Control icon in the left sidebar or press Ctrl + Shift + G to open the Git view.
You'll see a list of changes in your repository. You can stage changes, commit, pull, and push using the buttons provided.
With the Git extension installed, VSCode provides a user-friendly interface to interact with Git. You can easily commit changes, push to remote repositories, pull changes, and manage branches without having to use the command line.
